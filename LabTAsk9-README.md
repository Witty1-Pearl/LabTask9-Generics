Lab Task 9 􀈮 Introducing Generics
1. Intergenic Research Library provides extensive collection of books to the students of Genic University. The Research Library becomes an important exploring tool around for all the current students who hold the University IDs.
The books in Intergenic Research Library are mainly categorized into the following:
􀀹 Archaeological
􀀹 World Music and Poetry
􀀹 Art
􀀹 Historical Collections
􀀹 Medical Science, Population Science, Environmental Science
􀀹 Teaching and Learning
􀀹 Photography
􀀹 Film and Theatre
􀀹 Law
The library is open during weekdays from 9-5 pm and is closed on weekends. However, if there is any examination that is fast approaching, the library will be open on special request. The events in the library are updated every weekend. The deadlines for closing all the accounts in the library are at the end of the corresponding academic year.
Since the university has its population increasing year by year, the librarian requests to prepare software that will help the library staff to settle the accounts.
Therefore, the IT team of the university thus decides to help the librarian by creating software that uses the concepts of Generics. The details that were given to the software team are as follows:
a) Name of the student
b) Year of study
c) The book that the student has taken:
􀀹 Name of the book
􀀹 ID of the book
d) The date on which the book was issued
e) The date on which the book is to be returned
f) Name of the studen􀂝􀂜􀈱􀂠􀂑􀂘􀈱􀂑􀂊􀂟􀂎􀂗􀈂􀂝􀈱􀂛􀂎􀂝􀂞􀂛􀂗􀂎􀂍􀈱􀂝􀂑􀂎􀈱􀂋􀂘􀂘􀂔
􀀹 Name of the book that was not returned along with the ID of the book
Hence, use the idea of interface IDefaulterList to declare methods in C#:
a) GetName(): To get the name of the student.
b) GetYear(): To display the year in which the student is working.
c) GetBook(): To get the details of the name and ID of the book.
d) GetDateIssue(): To display the date when the book was issued.
e) GetDateReturn(): To display the date when the book is supposed to be issued.
f) GetDefaulter(): To get the names 􀂘􀂏􀈱􀂊􀂕􀂕􀈱􀂝􀂑􀂎􀈱􀂜􀂝􀂞􀂍􀂎􀂗􀂝􀂜􀈱􀂠􀂑􀂘􀈱􀂑􀂊􀂟􀂎􀂗􀈂􀂝􀈱returned the book. This method should also include the name and ID of the book that was not returned.
Now, create a class Library that will implement the interface IDefaulterList. Create a generic class GenericDefaulterList with the type parameter applied on the interface IDefaulterList.
Finally, create a main method in the class UniversityLibrary that will in turn create an instance for the class GenericDefaulterList that has its type parameter value as Library, since the class Library implements the interface IDefaulterList.
Display the required details in an orderly manner using format specifiers. Ensure that the date displayed is in appropriate date format.
